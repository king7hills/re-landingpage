Reverse engineer a landing page, TOP Foundations Project

In this project, I am taking a finished site picture and reverse engineering it's underlying code.
Rather than use the same boring filler text, I choose to create a Robot Plumbing company. Dave happens to be the name of the owner who manages his robot plumbers.

I will most likely utilize some AI generated images for creative robot plumber pictures.

All code is generated by me without the aid of AI.
